# AI Act Watch – Next.js MVP

Deploy with Vercel:
1) Create GitHub repo and push these files at the **top level** (package.json must be in repo root).
2) In Vercel → New Project → import the repo → Deploy.
3) Settings → Domains → add `aiactwatch.com` and redeploy.

If Vercel build fails, set Node to 18.x and clear cache, then redeploy.
